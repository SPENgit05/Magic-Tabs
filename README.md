# 🎸 Magic Tab  

**Magic Tab** is an experimental web app that listens to music (starting with single notes) and automatically converts them into guitar tablature. The goal is to make it easy to generate tabs for any sound or melody — from simple jingles to full songs.  

---

## 🚀 Project Concept  
- Upload an audio file with clear single notes.  
- The backend detects pitches using audio analysis.  
- Notes are mapped to guitar strings and frets.  
- The frontend displays the result as guitar tablature.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

**Backend (Python):**  
- **Flask** → lightweight API server  
- **Librosa** → audio analysis, pitch detection  
- **NumPy** → numeric calculations  
- **FFmpeg** → audio file handling  

**Frontend (JavaScript):**  
- **React** → frontend framework  
- **Vite** → fast development/build tool  
- **Tailwind CSS** → simple, clean UI styling

## 🛠 Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- Python **3.10+**  
- Node.js **18+**  
- ffmpeg (check with `ffmpeg -version`)  

### Backend Setup  
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run backend:

python app.py

Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

🎵 Usage

Start backend and frontend.

Open the web app in your browser.

Upload an audio file (WAV/MP3 with single notes).

See generated guitar tabs in the UI.

✅ Current MVP Goals

 Upload an audio file

 Detect single-note pitches (monophonic)

 Map notes → guitar strings/frets

 Display basic tablature in the browser

🔮 Roadmap (Future Work)

 Support polyphony (chords)

 Handle real-time recording & live input

 Export to Guitar Pro or MIDI formats

 Package as mobile app (React Native)

 Improve fretboard logic (choose best string/fret positions)
